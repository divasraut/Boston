# Boston
This notebook focuses on Regularization techniques using Ridge and Lasso Regression to improve linear regression models.
It applies L2 (Ridge) and L1 (Lasso) penalties to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
Summary of Steps
Loaded the Boston Housing dataset.

Checked dataset structure and added the target variable.

Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%).

Applied Ridge Regression (L2 regularization).

Applied Lasso Regression (L1 regularization).

Evaluated both models using RÂ² scores.

Final Thoughts
Ridge Regression (L2): Prevents overfitting but keeps all features.

Lasso Regression (L1): Helps in feature selection by eliminating less important features.
